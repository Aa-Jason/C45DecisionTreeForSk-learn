# C45DecisionTreeForSk-learn

## This is a C4.5 decision tree implementation perfectly adapted to the sk-learn interface, you can copy it into your project and use it directly.

#### C4.5 The decision tree is based on the information gain ratio as the criterion for dividing attributes, rather than the information gain used in ID3. We noticed that sklearn does not provide the implementation of the C4.5 decision tree. For this reason, I implemented the C4.5 decision tree that can perfectly adapt to the sklearn interface by inheriting the DecisionTreeClassifier interface in sklearn. If you need, just add C4.5.py directly to your project without worrying about adaptation.
